## Setup 📝

### Prerequisites: ⚙️
- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- A `.env` file with the necessary API keys (see below).

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhanarajrk/MoonKnight.AI.git
cd MoonKnight.AI
```

### 2. Setup Server (Backend) 🔧

1. The backend is included in the root folder. Ensure you have the following `.env` file in the root folder with the necessary environment variables:

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
POLLINATION_API_KEY=your_pollination_api_key
IMAGE_KIT_ENDPOINT=your_imagekit_endpoint
IMAGE_KIT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_imagekit_public_key
IMAGE_KIT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_imagekit_private_key
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000  # or the URL of your frontend
```

2. Since the backend dependencies are already uploaded in the `node_modules` folder, you can skip the `npm install` for the server.

3. Start the server:

```bash
npm run devStart
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3080`.

### 3. Setup Client (Frontend) 🌐

1. Navigate to the `client` folder:

```bash
cd client
```

2. Install client-side dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `client` folder with the following content:

```env
REACT_APP_IMAGE_KIT_ENDPOINT=your_imagekit_endpoint
REACT_APP_IMAGE_KIT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_imagekit_public_key
```

4. Start the client:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.
